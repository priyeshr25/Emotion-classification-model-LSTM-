Emotion Detection Web App 🎭

This project is an Emotion Classification Web Application built using Deep Learning (TensorFlow/Keras) and Streamlit. The app takes a user-entered sentence and predicts the emotion associated with the text along with a confidence score.

🔧 Tech Stack
Python,
TensorFlow / Kera(LSTM),
Streamlit,
NumPy,
Pickle

⚙️ How It Works
User enters a sentence in the Streamlit UI
Text is tokenized and padded to a fixed length
The trained model predicts emotion probabilities
The emotion with the highest probability is selected


The app displays:
- Predicted Emotion
- Prediction Confidence
